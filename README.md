# F1 Telemetry Delta Calculator

A high-precision Formula 1 telemetry delta calculation engine designed for professional race analysis and 3D visualization pipelines. This tool replicates industry-standard delta calculation methodologies used by F1 teams and broadcast partners.

## Overview

This repository contains a sophisticated F1 telemetry processing system that calculates lap-time deltas between drivers with maximum accuracy, regardless of data quality variations. Originally developed for technical artists working in Formula 1 visualization, it serves as the data foundation for automated 3D race comparison animations.

## Key Features

- **High-Precision Delta Calculation**: Implements industry-standard methodologies for maximum accuracy
- **Robust Data Processing**: Handles varying data quality and sampling rates across different F1 sessions
- **MSE-Based Alignment**: Advanced windowed Mean Square Error optimization for telemetry synchronization
- **Professional Visualization**: F1InsightsHub-style plotting with broadcast-quality aesthetics
- **3D Pipeline Integration**: Seamless data export for downstream 3D animation workflows
- **Multi-Session Support**: Works with Practice, Qualifying, and Race sessions across all F1 seasons

## Technical Methodology

### 1. Custom Time Integration
- Ignores original timestamps to eliminate timing inconsistencies
- Calculates time through distance/speed integration
- Scales to match actual lap times for precision

### 2. Windowed MSE Alignment
- Divides track into analysis windows (default: 4 segments)
- Optimizes telemetry alignment using Mean Square Error minimization
- Tests distance offsets from -15m to +15m for best synchronization

### 3. Common Grid Resampling
- Resamples both telemetries onto uniform 5-meter distance grid
- Ensures consistent data points for accurate delta calculation
- Maintains data integrity through interpolation

### 4. Integration-Based Delta Calculation
- Calculates segment-by-segment time differences
- Uses trapezoidal integration for high accuracy
- Scales final result to match real lap time gaps

## Installation

### Requirements

```bash
pip install numpy pandas fastf1 scipy matplotlib
```

### Quick Start

```python
from f1_telemetry_delta import F1TelemetryDeltaCalculator

# Initialize for a specific session
calculator = F1TelemetryDeltaCalculator(2024, 'Q', 'BAHRAIN')

# Calculate delta between drivers
delta, distances, summary_df, laptime1, laptime2 = calculator.calculate_delta('VER', 'HAM')

# Generate professional visualization
calculator.plot_comparison(delta, distances, 'VER', 'HAM', laptime1, laptime2, style='f1insights')
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Delta Calculation

```python
# Initialize calculator
calc = F1TelemetryDeltaCalculator(2024, 'Race', 'Monaco')

# Calculate fastest lap comparison
delta, distances, data, t1, t2 = calc.calculate_delta('LEC', 'VER')

print(f"Maximum gap: {max(abs(delta.min()), abs(delta.max())):.3f}s")
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
# Custom alignment parameters
delta, distances, data, t1, t2 = calc.calculate_delta(
    driver1='VER',
    driver2='HAM', 
    num_windows=6,      # More precise alignment
    grid_step=2.5       # Higher resolution grid
)
```

### Data Export for 3D Pipeline

```python
# Export processed data for 3D animation
import json

export_data = {
    'distances': distances.tolist(),
    'delta': delta.tolist(),
    'driver1_speed': data['Speed_Driver1'].tolist(),
    'driver2_speed': data['Speed_Driver2'].tolist(),
    'lap_times': [t1, t2],
    'drivers': ['VER', 'HAM']
}

with open('telemetry_data.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(export_data, f)
```

## Integration with 3D Visualization Pipeline

This calculator is designed to integrate seamlessly with the [F1 3D Visualization Pipeline](https://github.com/lohithburra01/F1-3D-VISUALIZATION). The processed telemetry data provides the foundation for:

- Real-time 3D car positioning
- Delta visualization overlays
- Speed differential animations
- Camera path optimization
- Timing graphics automation

### Data Pipeline Flow

```
Raw F1 Telemetry → Delta Calculator → JSON Export → 3D Animation System
```
